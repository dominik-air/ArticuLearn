# ArticuLearn

## About ArticuLearn
The goal is to build a web application aimed towards people struggling with expressing themselves in a clear and concise way.
Ideally, the learning process should be as interactive as possible, since there's already a lot of resources on-line on the topic.
The recent development of smaller, yet functional, LLMs seem to be promising enough to give it a try as the main driver of the practice sessions.
There's also an option to stick to the OpenAI API's free tier if anything else fails.

## Project scope (features)

- Lessons - either a short text or embedded video with an optional quiz at the end.
- Practice Session - real-time exercises with a language model.
- Learning Path - a collection of lessons and practice sessions in a specific order.
- Badges - users receive a badge after completing a part of a learning path. Keeps track of the user's progress in a gamified way.
